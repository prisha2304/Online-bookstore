        The Mahābhārata is one of the two major Smriti texts and Sanskrit epics of ancient India revered in Hinduism, the other being 
        the Rāmāyaṇa.[5] It narrates the events and aftermath of the Kurukshetra War, a war of succession between two groups of princely
         cousins, the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas.

<br>
t also contains philosophical and devotional material, such as a discussion of the four "goals of life" or puruṣārtha. Among 
the principal works and stories in the Mahābhārata are the Bhagavad Gita, the story of Damayanti, the story of Shakuntala, the story of 
Pururava and Urvashi, the story of Savitri and Satyavan, the story of Kacha and Devayani, the story of Rishyasringa and an abbreviated 
version of the Rāmāyaṇa, often considered as works in their own right.

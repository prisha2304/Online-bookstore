    who loves you who hurts you the most. Lily hasn?t always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life

    started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily?s life 
    suddenly seems almost too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He?s also sensitive, 
    brilliant and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn?t hurt. Lily can not get him 
    out of her head. But Ryle?s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception
     to his ?no dating? rule, she can not help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new 
     relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan?her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her 
     kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. With this bold 
     and deeply personal novel, Colleen Hoover delivers a heart-wrenching story that breaks exciting new ground for her as a writer. 
     Combining a captivating romance with a cast of all-too-human characters, it ends with us is an unforgettable tale of love that 
     comes at the ultimate price.

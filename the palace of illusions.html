        ‘An epic story ... poignantly told’ Hindustan Times ‘Radiant ... A charming and remarkable book’ Houston Chronicle ‘As bright a 
        gem as the Hope Diamond’Los Angeles Times ‘A daring novel’ Vogue IndiaBe taken back to a time that is half history, half myth, 
        and wholly magical …First published in 2008, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's The Palace of Illusions has received wide acclaim for 
        giving a woman's take on the timeless tale that is the Mahabharata. Narrated by Panchaali, wife of the five Pandava brothers, 
        the novel traces her life from fiery birth and lonely childhood, where her beloved brother is her only true companion; through 
        her complicated friendship with the enigmatic Krishna; to marriage, motherhood and her secret attraction to the mysterious man 
        who is her husbands’ most dangerous enemy. This tenth anniversary edition, complete with a new author’s note, celebrates once 
        again a remarkable and deeply human story about a woman born into a man’s world.

        Have you ever been to the hills? Did you like the stay? Did hills make you forget all the stress, and you want to stay there 
        forever? Sounds cool, no? But what if you were told to stay in the mid-Himalayas under some obligations? Would you still like 
        it? Our protagonist didn't like it, though. So this is what happened. An undiagnosed and mysterious foot pain led Somesh Pandey
         to walk back to his roots from the USA as the medical tests failed to detect the complication, and he was advised to look for 
         alternatives to cure the imaginary pain. Immediately, his mother called him back to the village for some spiritual solution 
         and he was forced to stay there for two years. Merely a month had passed, and Somesh was super bored. He, however, tried to

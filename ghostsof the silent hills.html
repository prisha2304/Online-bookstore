        The dead do not rest till they get what they want. You have arrived in the hills. In here, you are surrounded by dense, menacing
         forests, enveloped in a deadly silence... You never know what lurks here in the Cold, dark night. Do not walk alone after 
         sunset in the hills. A beautiful woman in white haunts the Lonely pathways, looking to enchant and ensnare men... All the 
         people who died in accidents here... They say you hear their screams at night. And the deserted lodges sitting amidst lush 
         greenery and calm streams... Spirits lie in wait here, ready to prey on the living. There are sceptics who did not heed these 
         warnings. They tried to rationalize what they saw, what they felt. But when they came face to face with the beings that they 
         elieved didn’t exist, they couldn’t run away anymore... Ghosts of the silent hills is a collection that will make your nights 
         a little scarier, encompassing the very best spine-chilling stories based on true hauntings.

        What if you ran away from your life today?

Twenty years later, three people are looking for you.
<br>
One is dying to meet you again.
<br>
The other wishes you had never met them.
<br>
The third wishes they could have met you at least once.
<br>
You are one person. Aren't you? But you are not the same person to each of them.
<br>
Find the answers about your own life in this story about searching for love and discovering yourself. Join a broken but rising YouTube 
star Alara, a struggling but hopeful stand-up comedian Aarav, and a zany but zen beach shack owner Ricky. Together, take the journey to 
seek the truth behind the famous singer Elisha's disappearance somewhere by the deep sea in Goa.

Will you be able to find Elisha? Or will you end up finding yourself?

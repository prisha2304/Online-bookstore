        Born on the same day and at the same time, Druvan and Anvesha know they are soulmates in every sense of the word. Their parents,
         however, refuse to accept their 'togetherness' at first and try to tear them apart. Druvan and Anvesha try their best to 
         explain why that cannot happen.
<br>
<br>
In the same timeline, the world has made huge progress in science and some of the first experiments to combine the body and the soul 
have begun. This is an opportunity for them to prove their love and tell the world that it is love that can make the impossible, 
possible.
<br>
<br>
Druvan and Anvesha participate in the experiment as if their life depends on it, because it does. The only thing that remains to be 
seen is, will the dream of a man to control love and life come true? And when the time comes, can one stay true to their soulmate?
